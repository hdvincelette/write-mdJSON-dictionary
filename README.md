# About

## Introduction

Anyone who has written metadata in mdEditor knows creating dictionaries can be tedious and repetitive. This guide describes the R Project write-mdJSON-dictionary that can help streamline this process. Rather than defining data table attributes in mdEditor, users can fill out a tabular dictionary template and format it to mdJSON using an R script. This mdJSON can be imported in mdEditor to create a Dictionary record with data table attributes already defined.&#x20;



## Intended Use

The R Project write-mdJSON-dictionary is intended for anyone who writes mdEditor metadata. It is important to note this R script is meant to initiate mdEditor Dictionary records, not update them, which should be done manually in the [mdEditor](https://go.mdeditor.org/#/dashboard) web application. It is recommended users maintain the tabular dictionary as a human-readable reference for the associated data product.
